Recursion

In your own words, what is recursion?
Recursion is having a function that calls itself. When the function gets called,
it creates a stack and freeze until the function returns, then continues from the
point it freezed.


Why is it necessary to have a base case?
A base case is like the end point of a recursive call which is necessary to prevent
runtime error since the progression will continue until it hits the base case. 



Graphs

What is a graph?
How is a graph different from a tree?
Give an example of something that would be good to model with a graph.

A graph is like a relationship diagram with nodes and edges (the lines connect nodes). 
It can be directed (one node points to another) or undirected. Trees are one type of graphs 
that are directed and acylic. An example of a graph can be the relationship web 
of characters in a movie, where the characters are the nodes and the edges are the 
relationships.
